Senior Deisgn Projetc: Diagonistic Knee Sleeve to aid in injury diagnosis

The goal of this project it so design a sleeve that will be placed over the knee to aid in the physicains diagnosis. The sleeve will provide quantatitive information to the physcian performing the test for knee laxity exams like Lachman's. The tests done by the phsyicans are done based on feel and experience to determine the injury and its severity. This sleeve will give information to the laxity of each ligament in the knee and if the pateint is "guarding" the knee which could produce an inaccurate diagnosis. 

Test preformed:
Lachman - ACL
Valgus Stress Test - MCL
Varus Stress Test - LCL

3 Modules:
EMG: This is focus on muscle activation and determine if the muscles surrounding the knee are actviated or at rest. During these exams the patient should be relaxed, if the muscles are activated then the patient is gaurding. The program will read the muscles activity and determine if it goes out of resting range. If guarding does occur and led will signal showing the physican that there as interferance during the test.

Laxity: This is where the quantative data will be acquired. Here the decive will meausre the laxity of each of the ligaments that are tested. The decivce will provide the laxity in a measuremnt of mm. 

Severity Scale:
0-5 mm - grade 1/normal (injury)
5-9 mm - grade 2 
10+ mm - grade 3 (severe injury - most likely surgical)

Sleeve Deisgn: The sleeve needs to be flexible and used on patients of all sizes. Needs to hold all of the components and allow the physican to place it on the pateint easily and without irritating the knee.
